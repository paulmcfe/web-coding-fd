Okay, so I've styled this page to use white text on a black background. Yes, I suppose you could say that it’s cool or hip or whatever the kids are saying these days, but you know what else it is? Hard to read, that’s what! The problem is that there’s too much contrast between the pure black background and the pure white text. Your eyes rebel. Compare this with the text in the following paragraph:
</section>
<p>
See what I did here? I darkened the text just a bit and I lightened the background by a notch or two. The result is much less contrast between the text and the background, so it’s much more readable. Plus it’s still cool (or whatever).
