    In the end, what I think set PHP apart in the early
    days, and still does today, is that it always tries 
    to find the shortest path to solving the Web 
    problem. It does not try to be a general-purpose 
    scripting language and anybody who's looking to 
    solve a Web problem will usually find a very direct 
    solution through PHP. Many of the alternatives that 
    claim to solve the Web problem are just too complex. 
    When you need something up and working by Friday so 
    you don't have to spend all weekend leafing through 
    800-page manuals, PHP starts to look pretty good.
