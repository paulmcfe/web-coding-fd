Here's what the great jurist Oliver Wendell 
Holmes, Sr. had to say about puns:
<blockquote>
A pun does not commonly justify a blow in return. 
But if a blow were given for such cause, and death 
ensued, the jury would be judges both of the facts 
and of the pun, and might, if the latter were of an 
aggravated character, return a verdict of justifiable 
homicide.
</blockquote>
Clearly, the dude was not a pun fan.
